# Throughput W3C - API Alignment

As part of the Throughput proposal this repository is used to document the alignment between the Throughput API and W3C Annotation standards.  As part of this work we model the Annotation standards (in RDF form) against Cypher/Graph objects as represented within Throughput.

This document serves as a resource for future developers within the Throughput project, and will form the basis for an annotation library.

## How to use this repository

This project will ultimately form an interactive web document with elements identified from the Throughput database, and with sample cypher queries for each of the W3C Annotation standards.

### Workflow Overview

This project relies on the W3C Annotation standards, and the OpenAnnotation extension.  This project uses the existing Throughput DB schema and data contained therein.

### System Requirements

Currently the project uses only Markdown.

### Data Requirements

This project will use an API connection to the Throughput database.

### Key Outputs

This project will result in the development of a single page application with example Cypher queries, along with data models for each of the W3C standards.

## Metrics

Metrics of success for this project include:
  * Completeness - how many of the W3C Annotation examples have:
    - Cypher equivalents
    - API equivalents
    - Images/data renderings
  * Website - is there a location to view the examples outside of the GitHub repository
  * Pageview/other metrics - How has this resource been used by others?
